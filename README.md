# DUNE-preCICE adapter

**experimental** preCICE-adapter for [DUNE](https://www.dune-project.org/), a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations.

The DUNE-preCICE adapter is a DUNE module. An example solver that uses the adapter is available in `dune-precice-howto/`. This is another DUNE module, based on the [dune-elastodynamics](https://github.com/maxfirmbach/dune-elastodynamics) module.
